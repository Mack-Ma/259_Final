% % From Wikipedia:
% % This distribution results from compounding a Gaussian distribution with 
% % mean mu and unknown precision (the reciprocal of the variance), with a 
% % gamma distribution with parameters a = df / 2 and b = df / 2*prec. In other 
% % words, the random variable X is assumed to have a normal distribution
% % with an unknown precision distributed as gamma, and then this is 
% % marginalized over the gamma distribution. (The reason for the usefulness
% % of this characterization is that the gamma distribution is the conjugate
% % prior distribution of the precision of a Gaussian distribution. As a 
% % result, the three-parameter Student's t distribution arises naturally 
% % in many Bayesian inference problems.)
